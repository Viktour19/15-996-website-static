  <h3 id="course-motivation">Course Motivation</h3>

<p><em>“There is a movement occurring…widely within our computing community, toward making tangible progress through intentional actions and interventions for advancing and valuing diversity, equity, and inclusion.”  (<a href="https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/dei-in-computing">ACM 2021</a>)</em></p>

<p>Our field is increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In addition to reducing pressing disparities and inequities in our community (e.g., <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2020/06/major-madness-racial-and-gender-equity-in-computer-science">1</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/04/01/stem-jobs-see-uneven-progress-in-increasing-gender-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/">2</a>), a climate in which people’s differences are honored and celebrated can <em>benefit all of us</em>, resulting in higher-impact research and greater inclusion felt by all (e.g., 
<a href="Chilton et al 2021">3</a>, 
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/sense-belonging-matters-s-why-academic-culture-needs-change">4</a>, 
<a href="https://ccl.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/129/2018/01/Brannon_et_al-2018-Social_Issues_and_Policy_Review.pdf">5</a>).</p>

<p>Throughout graduate school, we will encounter (and can create for ourselves!) many opportunities to help make the communities around us more welcoming to all (coming soon: a list of CMU student groups involved in DEI efforts). PhD students are also increasingly <em>expected to</em> engage with DEI topics as part of our work, with hiring and admissions committees emphasizing reducing bias and increasing equity; grants and papers increasingly asking us to address our research’s social impact; and job applications placing more weight on applicants having made meaningful contributions to DEI during their PhD.</p>

<p>With the understanding that engaging productively with DEI topics requires education and practice, this course was created to help prepare PhD students to engage holistically in the CS community, even as it evolves to put increasing emphasis on Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="course-origins">Course Origins</h3>

<p>This course was created <strong>by PhD students, for PhD students</strong>, and it is designed with the perspectives of PhD students in mind. In particular, this course is:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>short</strong>: it is 6 weeks long, and it requires a total of 18 hours, in and out of class.</li>
  <li><strong>flexible</strong>: it is graded pass-fail based on effort and participation.</li>
  <li><strong>supportive</strong>: it is designed to support students with all incoming levels of knowledge.</li>
  <li><strong>nuanced</strong>: it approaches difficult questions through multiple literature-based lenses.</li>
  <li><strong>maximally relevant</strong>: all topics are considered primarily in reference to CS and PhD settings.</li>
  <li><strong>community-building</strong>: it is peer-taught and centered around cooperative learning.</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h3>
<p>The purpose of this course is two-fold: to introduce first-year PhD students to <strong>foundational ideas</strong> about J, E, D, and I, and helping them build <strong>applicable skills</strong> they can benefit from through their PhDs.</p>

<p><strong>Applicable Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Bravely, knowledgeably, and inclusively discuss JEDI-related topics.</li>
  <li>Name key JEDI-related concepts in day-to-day interactions.</li>
  <li>Advocate for and care for oneself and others using known theories, strategies, and campus resources.</li>
  <li>Apply evidence-based inclusive practices in daily research, teaching, campus committees, and leadership positions.</li>
  <li>Identify new JEDI topics of interest and self-educate on them.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="content-format-core-questions-lenses-and-the-jigsaw-method">Content Format: Core Questions, Lenses, and the Jigsaw Method</h3>

<p>One of the key learning approaches we use in this class is based on the <em>Jigsaw Method</em>, which has been the subject of significant research and has been shown to strengthen community among students (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)">Wikipedia page</a> for details). This method is implemented in our class through <strong>Core Questions</strong> and <strong>Lenses</strong>.</p>

<p>Each week of class is designed around exploring a <em>core question</em>, which is a concrete question that is used as a an entry-point to large, foundational JEDI topics known as <em>lenses</em>. We visualize the relationship between these components as below:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="aboutpage_lensesQs.001.png" alt="My Image" /></p>

<p>Students are permanently assigned to groups of 4-5, and each week, each group member is assigned a lens. It is their responsibility to develop some of their own ideas about the core question through their assigned lens. In class, discussion then proceeds in two steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Within-lens knowledge sharing.</strong> Here, students participate in a moderated discussion with other students assigned to the same lens, with the goal of sharing knowledge and having quesitons answered.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Cross-lens knowledge sharing.</strong> Then, students bring their knowledge from Step 1 to their small group, where they synthesize their collective knowledge via a discussion activity.</p>

<p>Specific core questions and lenses vary year-to-year. See the Course Schedule on the “Spring X” page of this website for those used in the most recent offering.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="course-foundations">Course Foundations</h3>

<p><br /> 
<strong>1. Evidence-based inclusive teaching practices.</strong></p>

<p>The course is built upon evidence-based inclusive teaching practices, drawn primarily from the resources of CMU’s Eberly Center for Teaching and Learning. These practices include providing…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Background knowledge and supporting resources for newcomers to the material</li>
  <li>Clearly stated requirements, instructions, and rubrics</li>
  <li>A Discussion Guide with community guidelines and resources to support safe discussion</li>
  <li>Learning materials in diverse mediums (e.g., written, watched, listened to, etc.)</li>
  <li>Opportunities for diverse forms of learning</li>
  <li>Individual and group choice in almost all assignments and activities</li>
  <li>Explicit avoidance of teaching certain opinions as “correct” / “incorrect” or “good” / “bad”</li>
  <li>Content warnings on particularly sensitive material</li>
  <li>Content following accessibility guidelines and flexibility for accessibility aids</li>
  <li>A variety of channels for giving feedback, including an anonymous option</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Centering of marginalized perspectives and narratives.</strong></p>

<p>The course presents students with wide-ranging perspectives, particularly seeking to amplify the research and narratives that may be underrepresented in STEM fields. The course puts a particular emphasis on learning from anecdotes and personal narratives, seeking to counter the STEM tendency to view exclusively numerical data as the highest caliber of evidence.</p>

<p><strong>3. Balanced support and responsibility.</strong></p>

<p>The course aims to offer unconditional support to students and to reduce their barriers to learning at all opportunities. In equal measure, this course also asks students to take the primary responsibility for their own education, requiring them to make choices about how to engage with the material, to explore their own interests, to self-reflect, and to consider how they can contribute to making computer science more inclusive.</p>

<p><strong>4. Instructors trained on core attitudes: accountability, humility, and openness to feedback.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to being trained in moderation and de-escalation techniques, the instructors of this course are trained to…</p>

<ol>
  <li>recognize the position of power they hold as an instructor</li>
  <li>openly accept accountability for the impact of their actions, even if it differs from their intent</li>
  <li>approach the course with humility, recognizing that they can always learn</li>
  <li>process and accept feedback in a way that honors the effort associated with providing it</li>
</ol>

<p>If you feel that these foundations are not being sufficiently upheld, we want to know. See the current semester’s course page for information on how to give feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Foundational Ideas</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Our identities, which may be visible or invisible, shape our experiences in overlapping and context-dependent ways.</li>
  <li>People are experts on their own experiences, and engaging with people’s stories can be just as informative as looking at numeric evidence</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Someone else may experience the same situation differently than we do, sometimes in ways that we do not observe or understand.</li>
  <li>Our actions may have different impacts than we intend, and a central part of inclusion is to engage with that impact.</li>
  <li>Academic culture can make it challenging to show ourselves care, but doing so is our right, there are many strategies and campus resources that can help.</li>
  <li>Being an ally to others is an <em>action</em>; it involves work, self-examination, and sometimes risk.</li>
  <li>We are all capable of helping make our community more welcoming, and there exist resources, ongoing efforts, and experts (at and beyond CMU!) that can help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Content Format: Core Questions and Lenses. 
The homeworks and in-class activities in this course are built around the Jigsaw Method, an evidence-based approach to cooperative learning shown to strengthen community. Each week, the class will work together to explore a core question. We explore this core question from many angles, which we call lenses.
Week 1: Introduction + Identity (no core questions or lenses)
Week 2: Foundations of Inequality
Core question: How can inequality be perpetuated by a policy or criterion that intends to be neutral to people’s identities?
Lens 1: Implicit Bias
Lens 2: Intersectionality and the complexity of identity
Lens 3: Privilege and oppression via policies
Lens 4: Privilege and oppression via cultures and norms 
Week 3: Foundations of Identity Safety
Core question: How can we decrease stereotype threat and increase identity safety in academic/research settings?
Lens 1: Understanding and addressing stereotype threat
Lens 2: Structural strategies for increasing identity safety
Lens 3: Interpersonal strategies for increasing identity safety 
Week 4: Intent versus Impact
Core question: How should we account for the difference between the intent and impact of our (and others’) words and actions?
Lens 1: Microaggressions and verbal slights
Lens 2: Responding effectively 
Lens 3: Charged language in the academic context
Week 5: Well-being in the PhD Program
Core question: What are some strategies for maintaining our mental and emotional well-being during the Ph.D. program?
Lens 1: Mental health
Lens 2: Rights, boundaries, and self-advocacy
Lens 3: Self-compassion
Week 6: Allyship and promoting positive change
Core question: How can we contribute to creating an inclusive CS environment?
(no lenses)</p>

<p>*A more detailed class schedule is linked above, and an abridged version is found on the website.</p>

<p>Small discussion groups. 
Based on students’ responses to a survey (in which they can voice preferences about who they are grouped with), students are assigned to groups of 4-5. Barring any issues, these groups are fixed for the duration of the course. Group assignments are found in the “Groups and Lenses” file linked at the top + on the website.</p>

<p>Out-of-class work. 
In a typical week, students must complete two out-of-class assignments:</p>

<p>Pre-class activity (takes approx. 60 mins) 			Due 11:59pm Wednesday before class, weeks 2-6
Students prepare to contribute to in-class discussion by researching the core question through one of the lenses of the week, and then writing up their findings. Links to these activities are found on the course website.
Post-class reflection (takes approx. 30 mins) 			Due 11:59pm Friday after class, weeks 1-5
In this reflection, students do an activity of their choice to help them follow up on lingering ideas and new questions encountered in class. students should spend about 30 minutes completing a short reflection activity of their choice after class. Links to the instructions for this reflection (which are consistent week to week) are found on the course website, and at the top of the syllabus.
In-class schedule.
In a typical week, class time is spent as follows:
(5 min) 	Relaxation exercise via the Headspace app, designed to help students be present in class.
(30 min)	Guest lecture by a domain expert
(15 min)	Discussion part 1: within-lens knowledge sharing
Students participate in a moderated discussion with other students assigned to the same lens, with the goal of sharing knowledge and having questions answered.
(20 min) 	Discussion part 2: Cross-lens knowledge sharing. 
Students convene with their small group, where they synthesize their knowledge across lenses via a discussion activity. Instructions for discussion activities are found in the Discussion Guide.
(5 min) 	Share takeaways from discussion.</p>
